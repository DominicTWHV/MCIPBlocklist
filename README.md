# MCIPBlocklist
A list of IPs that my own system gathered running `Anti_Server_Scanner`

# To use:

You do NOT need a proxy server to use the set, however, it is required if you wish to use the main script at `Anti_Server_Scanner`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DominicTWHV/MCIPBlocklist.git
cd MCIPBlocklist
sudo chmod +x *.sh
./pipeline.sh
```

The pipeline script will perform the rest of the setup.

Then enter 'set.txt` when prompted for file path.

# Disclaimer:

The set may contain false IPs flagged by the automated script, try disabling the set if you have issues with specific players.

Additionally, you may want to set up your own script, just clone the repository at `https://github.com/DominicTWHV/Anti_Server_Scanner` and read the instructions there for setting up.
